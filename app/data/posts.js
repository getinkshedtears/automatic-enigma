Your friendly local pawnbroker was hovering near the end of the counter with an unsharpened pencil fulcrumed between his first two fingers, tapping on the edge with the fossilized eraser and watching the rutting out of the corner of his eye. Dull stuff: girl young but already blasé, big-titted, tattoo of a flower on her collarbone; the man ugly, sunburned back, sweating; the sheets off-yellow and the room peeling, slatted half-open blinds feeding an occasional flare of sunlight into the unsteady eye of the camera lens. It wasn’t a turn on as much as background noise, there for the same reason that some people leave on news feeds or a run a fan. Kill the silence.' +
            '<p>And silence was effectively slain: the volume was cranked up as high as it would go. Tinny, distorted animal sounds, panting and grunting and fevered slapping of flesh against flesh; the odd incomprehensible exclamation in maybe-Spanish expanded into the most cobwebbed of corners.' +
            '<p>Except for the spiders and the dust mites and the ghosts and Never, the store was unoccupied. Last sign of life had been a few hours ago, a stout housewifey type with an updo like a malformed second head who had fluttered in and waved around the same square-cut diamond ring she always pawned when money was tight. No one since then, until the jangle of the dented bell above the door announced a visitor. Never swiped the volume down with the side of a pinky, turning it down just enough that he didn’t feel like he had to roar his casual and poorly-pronounced “Funyihng” at the man who had stepped in. Unfamiliar face. Not a regular. And immediately after the greeting slipped off of his tongue, the girl in the video let out a off-kilter, high-pitched noise that communicated more alarm than pleasure. He didn\'t look down.'

Never, taking a covetous shine to it, had asked few questions, paid out too much and adopted it as his own directly the whine of hinges marked the harried-looking hawker’s outlet. On Tuesday it was in this chair that he reclined behind the counter – fairly supine, feet propped on a subwoofer, contemplating the sensation of his teeth sinking into a soy-braised pig’s ear, soft flesh first and the satisfaction of crisp cartilage – when sounded the crash.' +
            '<p>It was a messy clatter, obviously the introduction of something fragile to the wooden floor’s company, trailed by a squeak or a squawk of dismay. Just two people in the shop: Never and Ya, the teenage daughter of one of the neighborhood cha chaan teng. For the past few weeks, he had been paying her a little to come around and take out the dog, whose favored expression of boredom was mastication and who was always bored without more exercise than Never was personally willing to supply. A few minutes earlier she had dropped the dog off and remained to loiter among the merchandise, which was fine as long as everything she touched remained in one piece.' +

Bodhisattva-with-lion miraculously intact a few centimeters away. Something about the startled look on her round little rabbit face sent a pulse of irritation up his wrists. He stood, plucked a screwdriver from the counter, and made to follow the first projectile with one better-aimed. She must have realized his intent, because she performed an awkward lurch forward, stumbled to her feet, and hurtled out of the shop with a grind of glass beneath her heels – the impact of the screwdriver rattled the door frame after she had made it through.' +

The sight of the girl interrupting her getaway to offer a nanosecond\'s post-near-collision bow to the other party before scuttling off was enough to inspire an eruption of laughter, for which his dismissive waving of a hand in the woman\'s direction was probably not, he realized, commensurate explanation.'

Somewhere below, the usual miasma of saline, fish market, smelted metal, bodies, orchids, the dog whistle whine of the modern age. And it was good to wade through that too, sometimes, but here in the cumulus-tickling heights Hwei-Ru reposed unreachable, dragonfly-dancing her attention back and forth between black lacquered fingernails as filtered through a flute of Chartreuse, and Sardar, hunched forward in his chair beside her: she wished she excelled at the pretense of disinterest.

	text: '<p>The Count Anatoli Petrovich Shuvalov had, while he lived, possessed a dedication to orderliness that was kindly described by those in his circle as “staunch.”  Less kindly, it was fanatical.  Whenever the subject arose in the course of conversation (“But you, Anatoli Petrovich, turn crimson to see a single thing out of place!”), the count himself invoked his score of years as an imperial <i>rotmistr</i> as the root of his fastidiousness.  Since many of his acquaintances had been similarly installed in the military and experienced no such effects, their acceptance of his explanation was polite but without any real endorsement. In truth Anatoli Petrovich’s character was more inherent than learned, and it reflected in everything he touched: his person, his affairs, his properties.  Even his wife, who herself had no such inborn predilection, spent the twenty years of their marriage noticing crooked picture frames and minutely rotating jardinieres to please him.  It was the least, after all, that she could do.' +
	'<p>Now that he was gone – and whether the going were to great reward or to proper punishment, who could say? – the widow Ariadna found herself inclined toward the slow unravelling of his impeccably-woven legacy, which she felt wrapped about her shoulders like a shroud.  She had rooms of furniture rearranged at odd angles, draped settees with okapi pelts, perched stuffed eagles at the top of curio cabinets, and filled her chiffonier with the raiment of far-off pagan lands.  Though friends looked on sadly, spoke gingerly, assumed it to be the temporary break of a woman bereft, the wildness that pleased her was imposed not in grief, as they imagined, or with spite, as one might think to watch her at the act, but as an expression of her own sovereignty, new and gratifying and well-earned.' +
	'<p>The principal Shuvalov residence, a house on Podrezova Street in Petersburg, being also the favored lodging of her only son, did not see the brunt of these atmospheric changes.  The sixteen year-old heir apparent was unusually articulate when it came to disapproving of his mother’s new eccentricities, which he could not recognize for what they were: old eccentricities long bottled.  Ariadna, unable to think of a reason to break her long-standing tradition of at once indulging and avoiding him, thus focussed her attentions rather on Svantovitskoe, the grand old estate whose boundaries sprawled along the southern shores of the Oka River, and where she and the count had always wiled away the too-brief Russian summers.' +
	'<p>It was toward this same Svantovitskoe which Matvei Tsivilko began to trudge the very moment Winter’s shadow over Moscow seemed at last to lift for good, in late March.  It was Svantovitskoe at which he arrived in early April, following a four-hundred kilometer trek through the muddy countryside.  And it was Svantovitskoe which became the object of his apprehensive stare when, upon his disembarkation from a pony cart whose driver had sullenly agreed to convey him from Ryazan, he became aware of a worrisome number of signs that the premises had been abandoned.' +
	'<p>The last time he had laid eyes on the property was six years ago, when his family attended a lavish party thrown by the Shuvalovs in honor of father and son’s Name Day.  The trip was not perfectly preserved in his memory, but he recalled with great clarity the impression that the manicured grass, lollipop shrubs, geometric flower beds and grand columns freshly painted white had come together to make in his mind.  Now clumps of knapweed speckled the lawn.  Bushes were untrimmed.  Paint flaked.  Hornets’ nests occupied the upper corners of the porch.' +
	'<p>He threw the tarnished brass knocker against the door, expecting nothing – or expecting that he would now have to come up with a new plan, when it had been all that he could do to come up with this one.  But a woman answered, a wrinkled housekeeper-crone in a headscarf, and when he announced himself as Ariadna Semyonovna’s relation, she ushered him in without so much as a question toward his bedraggled state.' +
	'<p>Until the beginning of May, Matvei hid himself in one of the many guest rooms, sleeping more than could be considered healthy and subsisting on the peasant fare shared by the skeleton staff who looked after things while Ariadna was away.  “Recuperation” was a word that he repeated to himself, but he had yet to feel much better than he when he left the city.  At least the smell of printer’s ink and musty books had been flushed from his nostrils.  Even walking past the library was apt to result in a sharp ache at the front of his forehead.' +
	'<p>Then in swept the lady of the house, accompanied by a retinue of servants and a pack of slavering hounds, each ostentatiously mismatched.  He braced himself for the inevitable demands of explanation, but suffered only a fleeting quizzical look from his mother’s cousin, after which the subject of his unheralded presence took on an aspect of the taboo.  No-one brought it up, at least not around Matvei himself.  And for that, he was grateful.  Grateful enough that, when Ariadna Semyonovna asked him to perform some task – the sort of task at which he would normally balk – he did it without question.  And this is how he found himself on the hard dirt road somewhere between Svantovitskoe and Ryazan, straddling one of the late Anatoli Petrovich Shuvalov’s prized but impractical Akhal-Teke mares, trying to chase down a stallion that, earlier in the morning, had been spotted galloping through a neighboring property.' +
	'<p>The air had felt unseasonably cool when he set off around ten o’clock, and he had wrapped himself in a black double-breasted coat before departing.  Now that the sun had reached its peak and begun on its course back down the other side of the firmament, Matvei found that he was sweltering underneath the wool and veered his gilded horse to the side of the road, where he tied reins around a crooked alder, stripped off his coat, and stood for a while with his back against the trunk, imagining the likelihood that his quarry had already broken its leg in a muskrat hole and been devoured by wolves.'

It was not, with its thirty floors, the city of Vineta’s tallest building (Reimer’s Tower, downtown) or even its most recognizable (Symphony Hall -- arguably), but it might have been its least subtle, straddling the sidewalk like a broad-shouldered goliath armor of fused plate glass and black steel.  <i>Look at me</i>, in fading voice.  Developers were bold and flaunted deep pockets in the nineties, when the high rise’s proposal and construction had been met with the usual concerned-citizen falderal: it was a view-ruining eyesore and clashed with every other manmade thing in the dressmaker district, etc.  But the outcry had faded as the units sold out one by one.  And why not?  The view from the south side was exquisite.  Now the few passers-by stalwart enough to face down the wind and pin-sharp raindrops, people who gripped their Burberry umbrellas tighter than their Givenchy wallets, refused the building a second glance.  It had been there as long as they could remember; it had lost its power to surprise or offend.' +
	'<p>On the twenty-second floor, something older than the Confesor Building, older than Vineta, older maybe than the bedrock into which the city’s foundations were drilled, stood in the shadow of a cloud-dimmed sunset with fingertips and forehead against the cold, clear membrane of the window, staring at the smeared reflection of a woman’s face over which it had only recently garnered a semblance of control, having writhed for a while in the confines of strange vein and sinew, wondering at the sting of time that harried the pale flesh in which it had found itself.' +
	'<p>Often it had taken a man’s shape, in those years when the sleek dark boys slaughtered villages for him in a dry country; when they worshipped him as the king of knives in Taremu;  when the milites threw their prisoners to slavering animals and cheers rang out as they were rent.  Then he had been dark and sleek himself and had counted days with the chattel and learned their manner of speech and granted what favors they asked, but he was never dying with them.  Never fragile.  Then humanity’s braying had grown tedious, and it had slipped away in other forms and in these forms had not lost – nevermind what the others thought – but deliberately cast away the superfluous trappings of mortality; law and language and time, “civilization,” piece by piece until only hunger and satisfaction remained, satisfaction and hunger, the snake that swallows its tail.  It lived one moment, infinite, with neither past behind nor present ahead.   So to guess how long it had indulged in that cycle, a hundred floods or a thousand since its kin had resigned the mundane world to the mundane hordes, was impossible.  Wretched flesh forced time on it by persistent dying.  Small wonder they felt the need to count seconds, hours, centuries.  They were always running out of time.  It had not meant to come back, but here it was.  She?  Sex had been shed with everything else, but the body was female, and possibly it was the body.  She had yet to decide.' +
	'<p>Since the infinity fractured, a faraway sun had risen four times.  Hardly anything accomplished.  Perhaps it was enough that the idea of accomplishment had been dredged up from distant memory.  The voice (an angry, confused, frightened remnant of the body’s original inhabitant) was quashed, at least.   They had fought: for the first few days, while the old monster compassed some mastery of human form -- fingers, toes, lips, tongue -- the displaced soul kept trying to wrest control away.  Not now.  Silence, now.  Mostly.  Not knowing how to purge its unlucky bedfellow entirely, it had only shut her away through an unalloyed force of will.' +
	'<p>There was very little that it would have professed to knowing.  Not when, or how, or why.  Where, a little.  High.  A birds’ aerie place.  It seemed the teeming masses of humanity had constructed a tower and filled it up with artifacts of which even the outwardly familiar were strange.  Outside, rain and countless points of light beneath an unclouded edge of setting sun.  She had not ventured beyond the door.  Not yet.  Not until she knew more.  She expected the man might have answers, but he spoke a tongue she had yet to unravel.  Such was mankind -- inventing more and more sounds for the same thing when only the thing was of any significance.  She had tested one or two old words on him, the most recent she could summon, and received incomprehension for her efforts.  But he kept coming back, after that first appearance with a cup of water when she was struggling, even after the aborted effort to tear out his throat (weak hands, trembling), and surely he must know something.  Only she had to make sense of it with this cage around her, limiting everything.  She heaved a frustrated breath and threw a hand against the window’s surface.  It held fast but reverberated with the thump of the blow.'

He could have grown a beard, worn sweaters embroidered with wide-antlered stags, relaxed a little and considered what to do from the cover of a mossy coastal cabin. Instead he was at an all-night Cuban diner, alone at a corner table on its sticky outdoor patio under an umbrella that was doing a fine job of keeping moonlight out of his eyes. For whatever that was worth. Fingers curled around, tapped at the side of, a half-full cup of coffee well on its way to lukewarm. He had taken maybe three bites of the frita on the plate in front of him. There was something unhealthy to the Miami air, the humidity shot through with a squalid combination of seasalt and rancid porkfat and exhaust, that strangled the appetite slowly like there was pleasure in it. Maybe it was him. Maybe his tastebuds were poisoned with a grudge. Well, he was doing what he could about that.</p>' +

Each mark reached out tendrils through space unseen to touch the rest. Enough alive at once formed what you call a fowler’s snare, but one managed to fade by the time two were added. It was a tedious and imperfect process; the repetition of it left his thoughts straying through the corridors of ritual: here were the red shapes and the words from Genesis that would leach the incoherence from his neighbors’ bickering, leave only raw significance which, revealed, would prove the effort wasted because the squabble was clearly about money or drugs or sex. What did he care? Moot anyway – the ingredients and he were spent.</p>' +

Before that he’d never had cause to consider himself and the possible procreative consequences of his pastimes in the same thought. By the time Oak/Ash/Elm/Arboretum had finished caterwauling and peeled off to the clinic with two weeks of his wages wadded up in her fist, he’d thought about what that picture would look like plenty, and he was damn sure he wasn’t about to let that happen again.</p>' +
