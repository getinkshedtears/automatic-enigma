        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline; padding-bottom: 15px;">Thirty-two years ago, someone had the poor judgment to name a child after the negation of time and possibility.</span>' +

        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline padding-bottom: 15px;">' +
        '<p>Never Amirbeyov does not exist.  Not in the registers, anyway.  For officiality, for the bureaucracy, he is what his parents called him: Enver.  A real name, appropriated from an old acquaintance in an old country.  There was a story once, about what deeds consummated the original Enver’s right to a namesake.  It’s forgotten now, slipped in and drowned somewhere along the passage of time.  No one has called the tributary Enver by his given name these fifteen years.</p>' +
        '<p>The “Never” that has replaced it derives from the (presumably) innocent misreading of a classmate or a teacher or a government official.  He doesn’t remember, but he liked it.  It stuck -- and lucky the lapsus linguae was in English: he might have been Enfer.  Not that anything would have been different if he had.  Even the natural distorters of ligament and bone cannot hope to remake themselves with a word.</p>' +

        '<span style="width: 15%; float: left; display: inline;"><b>False</b></span>' +
        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline; padding-bottom: 15px;">Never is some kind of Russian.</span>' +
        '</div>' +
        '<div>' +
        '<span style="width: 15%; float: left; display: inline;"><b>True</b></span>' +
        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline;">' +
        '<p>The theory arises, and not unsoundly, from the Slavic sonance of his surname and the fact that he exercises a blunted version of the Russian language (last honed in earnest while his mother, who -- he <i>might</i> mention -- enjoyed others’ tongues but not other tongues, was still in the picture) in situations calling for obfuscation.  But he is second-generation New Victorian, born and raised.</p>' +
        '<p>Likewise, his people were not Russians, but Azeri desert hounds.  His line is deep rooted; Mazdeans and Khurramites, acculturated over generations beside the Caspian.  When the dakhmas they had scavenged for thousands of years fell out of fashion, they were obliged to employ subtler, more modern means of finding meals, and thus turned respectable.  Though not without their idiosyncrasies, their clannish tendencies, their inexorable canons, as a tribe they weathered the upheavals with their mundane neighbors none the wiser to their common ancestry with the Bardi.  So they preferred it, and so it was that, despite the changing attitudes of the world, Never’s upbringing stressed keeping head down and heritage bottled.  A sense of oppression was what stirred the first feelings of rancor in him, but that came after.</p>' +
        '<p>Before, nearly a century ago, Never’s late father returned to Shirvan from Volgograd, bearing a freshly-minted degree in pathological anatomy from the University there.  Second doctor in the family, the elder already operating a practice in Sumqayit with a fat wife and a squalling whelp.  The younger was to marry up: a black-eyed girl from Baku, a few offshoots of the extended family tree away.  She danced with the Çınar Ensemble, and her father was a deputy in the Milli Məclis.  It was all arranged.  Instead, he stole away with a young cousin, a striking girl at whose altar he had worshipped since he was twelve years old.  Their unsanctified coupling shattered taboo, and to avoid reprisal they travelled East, to Krasnoyarsk, where a friend of a friend helped the groom to attain a job performing autopsies at the municipal hospital.</p>' +
        '<p>This is History 101.  Never, despite his contempt for the good old days -- a reaction to the dogmatic traditionalism his parents, particularly his father, managed to maintain even in the heterodox surroundings of New Victoria -- memorized it by rote when he was too small to know insurgence.  It is as much a part of him as the Ahuna Vairya, de trop but indelible.  What ensued, the details surrounding their southward immigration three decades after this cosmogony, invariably failed to follow in the telling.  He assumes that the circumstances were similar to the ones that caused his family’s eventual disintegration.</p>' +
        '<p style="border-top: 1px dashed black; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; padding-bottom: 10px;"></p>' +

        '<div>' +
        '<span style="width: 15%; float: left; display: inline;"><b>False</b></span>' +
        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline; padding-bottom: 15px;">The Ossuary is a pawn shop.</span>' +
        '</div>' +
        '<div>' +
        '<span style="width: 15%; float: left; display: inline;"><b>True</b></span>' +
        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline;">' +
        '<p>The Ossuary is a crooked two-story construct wedged incongruously between the sleeker, more modern pillars of Wan Chai.  Never, not versed in patina or provenance, swapped its apparent business model from antique dealing to pawnbrokery when he took charge, though it remains marked only by a worn sign painted 骨董.  The 董 is faded just beyond legibility, and hence the name.</p>' +
        '<p>The real lifeblood of The Ossuary pulses beneath the above-ground facade, in the sepulchral basement room which, in the building’s long-ago incarnation as a tea shop, stored heaps of dried longjing and biluochun.  At present, on irregular nights, it houses the entertainment and the often-cruel games of chance which the grinning Never arranges for a carefully-curated flock of guests.  Some are neck-deep already, without hope of paying their debts the usual way.  Some have simply grown bored of the spinning of roulette wheels at the usual casinos and are titillated by the thought not only of exclusivity but of losing something more precious than cash -- though they lose that, too.  The remainder are there for the spectacle.  Come and see.</p>' +

        '</div>' +

        '<span style="width: 15%; float: left; display: inline;"><b>True</b></span>' +
        '<span style="width: 80%; float: left; display: inline;">' +
        '<p>Here is how Never wiled away his formative years: tormenting his older sister; earning below-average grades (a lack of effort here, a lack of aptitude there) and classmates\' mixed admiration (pretty eyes and an offhanded disregard for authority); resenting his mother’s abandonment; butting heads with his staid father; barely governing both the hungers that plague his kind and the waves of temper, the startling outbursts, that were his alone; and generally wending his way toward, if not a bad end, then at least not having lived up to expectations.  Here is how his father spent Never’s formative years: gambling away his livelihood.</p>' +
        '<p>One Spring morning, under the assumption that doing so would be preferable to facing his accrued debts, the latter offed himself, and never mind how he managed it.  The point is that, while he escaped responsibility, all obligations were transferred to the survivors, and “the survivors” boiled down to Never -- his mother having run off with another man when he was nine, and his sister abroad for her work -- a reality that came to light when the thugs arrived to declaim the amount still outstanding.</p>' +
        '<p>He was nineteen, living a jobless, aimless existence with a put-upon girlfriend.  Lacking both the means and the wherewithal to flee the newfound onus, and struggling with the quandary of procuring flesh without his pathologist father’s providing it, he accepted his creditors’ offer to work off his debts with them.  The arrangement began with picayune tasks but evolved, gradually, into an enforcer’s role, and here the boredom, the frustration, the umbrage, the strain against reticence that he had forever been tamping found outlet.  How much more difficult it is, to repair a hemorrhage than to cause one.  Even now it continues to issue with tumultuous ebb and flow.  In the best of moods, he is a hazardous thing, affable enough, in his blunt irreverence, right up until the moment that he isn’t.</p>' +
        '<p>These days, he is no longer in debt, but he is still in thrall.  His authority over The Ossuary is an extension of this long-ago agreement, a reward for past services, granted when the previous owner was rendered incapable of carrying out the job.  He tends the shop, both above and below; manages it; hires and fires; and lives on the second floor.  His name (the legal version) appears on the lease.  Still, he likes it there, likes the illusions: propriety, control, respect.  All achievements he was tempered to want but stood steadfastly against working for when he was younger.  But he does not operate without the oversight of a higher power.  The leash is long, yes, but anytime he makes the mistake of feeling like an independent entity, a glance down at his left hand -- the last two fingers missing -- is a reminder of how no-one is free.  </p>' +

        '<p>Eight matched coffee cups in the kitchen cabinet, arranged in two rows of four, handles facing out.  She takes the cup from the right front, careful not to jostle the others out of formation.  Crooked lines and uneven spaces bother her sometimes.  Streaks on windows, loose threads, dog-eared pages in books, sticky fingers, clumps of mascara: they make her uncomfortable, but only sometimes.  Still, what dishevelment she can stomach today presents a threat of chafing against her sensibilities tomorrow, and she has learned over three decades that it is always preferable to maintain order than be overwhelmed when her captious streak rears up.  Her home is the distillation of this philosophy.' +
        '<p>The apartment became hers after her father’s death.  They had not spoken in ten years, not after she became a novelty more than a daughter, but he left her the penthouse and whatever it contained.  Penance, probably.  For reasons that she cannot quite define, she was compelled to accept.  She took a sabbatical from the Los Angeles firm where she was on the way to become partner, moved across the continent, and began clearing the place out.</p>' +
        '<p>Two months on, and she has nearly managed to scrub Renato Saavedra’s residual presence away, though it had occupied every nook and cranny, sunk into the grain of the floors and crept into the upholstery like a stink.  His coffee cups were unmatched, faded and chipped.  She threw them out.  She replaced the excess of old furniture with a few pieces, angular and sleek.  One photograph remains on the wall in the living room, a family portrait taken in 2018 in which her six year-old self is smiling.  It hangs beside her LLM diploma.</p>' +
        '<p>A whole cadre of fanatics exists who would be scandalized at the systematic erasure of the vestiges of their golden idol from the place he called home.  These people have been her enemies for as long as she can recall, and with spite guarded in her heart she has ripped and recycled stacks of correspondences, donated signed first editions to second-hand stores, and burned a half-finished manuscript that, though she did not read it in full, seemed to involve a politician reincarnated as a Patagonian weasel -- the same fabulist garbage about which he always wrote, and which garnered him the accolades on which he thrived.</p>' +
        '<p>She pours coffee and lifts the cup to her lips with one hand, sips its contents while she frees her hair from a mesh of pins and elastic with the other.  Her curls tumble down, limp with sweat from her morning jog.  Time and again she has eyed the mirror and wondered if it wouldn\'t be easier to just crop it all off, but vanity stays her hand in the end.  She cannot loose herself from a concept of beauty that was outmoded years before she learned it: her mother insisted until her dying day that a woman’s hair is her greatest asset, that one day Anais’s would serve her well, better than her eyes, which would be a pretty shade of blue if only they weren\'t so grim; better than her lips, which were too thin for such a wide mouth.  Emma’s influence, too, that her daughter cannot bear to be seen in public without a varnish of makeup, without ironing her blouse and polishing the scuffs from her shoes.  A smudge of plum-colored lipstick remains on the edge of the cup, which she wipes away with her thumb.</p>' +
        '<p>The sun is simpering above the skyline now.  Her cup is a quarter full, three-quarters empty.  She places it on the kitchen table and goes to evict the man who is still asleep under her crumpled sheets.  Before sunrise he was a diversion, but the break of day paints him a nuisance, and she does not brook a nuisance.</p>' +
        '<p><b><center>Postscript</center></b><br>A few words about thanatotic impression</p>' +
        '<p>If Anais is within a ten foot (or so) radius of a person at the moment of his death, she is stamped with an indelible record of him within herself, which quickly fades into a collection of his more salient memories integrated into her own history in such a way that it becomes difficult for her to tell, without examination, if she actually experienced something she remembers.  She gains nothing useful from this phenomenon -- no skills, no talents, no significant knowledge -- just a cache of scattered, foreign memories.</p>' +
        '<p>The opportunity for this “power” to manifest does not arise often -- in fact three times in her life -- which is just as well.  It was not until the second time, when she was 24 and in law school, that it was classified.  She views it with a profound ambivalence, because even while the results are unsettling and potentially life-disrupting, they come part and parcel with a kind of voyeuristic thrill to which no other experience is comparable.</p>'

        id: 'edmund',
	image: 'images/bly.jpg',
        biography: '<p><b>APPEARANCE</b>: Here is Edmund, tall and still trim at fifty-one, possessing of serious grey eyes and thinning hair a shade lighter than those eyes. He is distinguished, with a face reminiscent of old Roman busts of Cicero. He is the kind of man whom the viewer may expect to open his mouth and quote Plutarch or Prufrock with equal ease. You will find that he does not disappoint on these accounts, although the latter gains unwieldy stiffness when recited in Edmund\'s impeccable RP (would you ever have guessed he was born and raised in the North?).</p>' +
                '<p>Propriety is his second skin. Straight-legged trousers and waistcoats, subdued jackets and loud neckties: these comprise his chameleon-flesh. His point of reference is about ten years out of date, but it becomes him. Lay him bare and see a different story: his body is a tapestry dedicated to his fascination with the alteration of human form. Everyone who places stock in the Divine Spark has their reasons; its validation of his long-standing obsession with the human physiology is a large part of Edmund\'s.</p>' +
                '<p>Witness, covering the whole of his back, plate seventeen from Blake\'s Book of Urizen, recreated with painstaking detail in the Japanese irezumi style (nara ink chiseled into the skin, monochrome greenish-blue). Ventral, from collarbone to pelvis and snaking down his left thigh, a Maori ta moko: a labyrinth of black, lyrical lines tracing his contours. Across both canvasses, it is possible to make out the scars of failed experiments with kavadi which, when practiced correctly, leaves no marks.</p>' +
                '<p>See the audacious apadrayva piercing [quick fourth-wall-breaking interruption: if you do not know, do not Google this at work], and below, the raised crocodile-skin pattern that covers the upper part of his right leg, done to emulate the style of natives of Australia. Notice how his hands and feet are bare, his face and neck, his calves and lower arms. This may someday change, if ever he no longer values the ability to hide himself. At present, though, it is important to be able to slip on the suit so you may see him as the experienced, educated gentleman that, of course, he is.</p>' +
                '<p><center><h2>Snapshots, 1894-present</h2></center>' +
                '<center><i>1894</i></center>' +
                '<p>The sun burnishes the countryside on a summer day: Edmund is five and tiger-wild, crashing through the bushes of the copse. He ignores his mother\'s demands that he slow down and stay on the path. He will stop only to catch his breath and wonder at the burning of the skin of his face where whipping branches have left their marks.</p>' +
                '<p>When you ask him, at age 51, about his earliest memory, he may defer to some pleasantry -- an opera or a thunderstorm over the ocean -- but this is how it happened:</p>' +
                '<p>They are summering with one of her cousins, and are walking this afternoon to a nearby estate, their destination separated from their host\'s land by a well-rutted vein of road down which, right now, a man in a surrey is goading his horse faster. They arrive at the intersection of the footpath and this road after the moment of collision. One girl has managed to evade the hooves and narrow wheels bearing down on her and her companion. She is crouched by the tree line, blanched and silent. The other lacked her friend\'s fortune and now lies some yards away.</p>' +
                '<p>The events that passed between the accident and Edmund\'s eventual realization that he was safe in bed have long been lost to time. What he remembers, his mind\'s eye renders as a Caravaggio, in colors bolder and detail more vivid than the scene could have realized in life. She is older than he-- twelve, maybe thirteen -- round-faced, dark. Around her, scattered daisies. The whole of her body is twisted into an unnatural pose that can only be the product of a broken back and dislocated joints. One arm is bent at such an angle as to have disappeared beneath her back. Her stillness is nearly complete, but that from her gaping mouth issues, along with a growing stream of blood, a soft, watery wail. She is speckled all over with patches of blood soaked through gingham and the shadows cast by the leaves of the tree above. She predicates all things.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1901</i></center>' +
                '<p>The boy on the train is tall for his age, child-skinny yet but with the beginnings of a musculature that is already helping to distinguish him in football, in rugby, and in the less-approved arena of the schoolyard fistfight. A stranger asks him if he is heading home for Christmas. He tells her "yes," omitting that there is no Christmas celebration at his home.</p>' +
                '<p>He still answers to "Ed." There will come a time when he sheds any acknowledgment of the nickname, deciding it lacks dignity. For now, he is the twelve year-old that the other public school boys refer to as "Ed" or "Bly" or (sometimes congenially, sometimes no) as "the bastard." This last is not out of any circumstance of birth, but mostly because King Lear still burns fresh in their schoolboy minds, and because some take his confidence as a personal affront.</p>' +
                '<p>Edmund doesn\'t mind. He does, and will always, possess a preternatural sense of where he stands with others, of how far he can go: his teachers appreciate his cleverness and retention; his peers, for the most part, will rise to follow when he rallies -- as they will shy from he raised hand. Besides this, he liked Edmund, though he preferred the fool. He finds that he can rattle off the fool\'s speeches to great effect.</p>' +
                '<p>He preferred even more Titus Andronicus, which he came across in the library and read in the secret, stomach-tingling way that children interact with the Verboten. When he lies awake in the dormitory at night and does what boys do, he finds his thoughts all run in rivulets toward Lavinia.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1909</i></center>' +
                '<p>The beauty of being a younger son: that he is not required to take over the duties of the father. In later years, secretive fits of self-doubt will drive Edmund to wonder if Freudian thinking isn\'t entirely without merit. He does, after all, hate his father, a feeling which seems to be the foundation of psychoanalysis.</p>' +
                '<p>Fifteen and granted the unsought burden of the Gnostic Mysteries, that feeling is particularly strong. Until now, he has lived with only half-conscious knowledge that he is not a member of the Church of England. Here is the old man, in his study, expounding on rites and degradation, isolation, enlightenment. Edmund listens, absorbs, and concludes that he will allow this secret world to be John\'s domain, as it would be his lot to take over the family business, if a family business there were. No divine spark will interfere with the mundane arrangements that Edmund has already made for his life (university, medical school, a good marriage, a prestigious career), only he is aware of an unpleasant sensation that this new cognizance will one day swallow him whole.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1915</i></center>' +
                '<p>In the year since his enlistment, Edmund has led a schizophrenic existence, a carousel ride going round and round between the tense camaraderie of the officers\' lounge (off-kilter sounds of orchestras shrunk to fit the Victrola make him yearn for the wide-open acoustics of the concert hall), and the waking-nightmare world of the battlefield (faceless soldiers; limbs rank with gangrene; good men choking and choking and choking on a lung\'s-worth of gas).</p>' +
                '<p>He was fresh out of medical school in 1914. From Downing College to Cambridge, from Cambridge to St. Bartholomew\'s Hospital, from Bart\'s to the Western Front. His surgical work had been done, for the most part, on cadavers. There is no danger in ruining dead flesh. If he pauses and thinks, it is strange to have become even this inured to working on writhing, bellowing bodies. He still bolts up at night, his head echoing revenant dreams.</p>' +
                '<p>A terror of mortality: he cannot admit it to another living soul, but that is the black worm twisting in his gut. In times of war or turbulence, it cannot be strange for men to turn back to the faith of their fathers. This is his thought while he writes to John for books and guidance.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1917</i></center>' +
                '<p>The letter takes him by surprise: the nurse from the Paris hospital would like him to know that he is a going to be a father, if he does not object. Instinct tells him that he will not be an ideal father, or even a good one. In a fit of sympathy, he cannot bring himself to object.</p>' +
                '<p>The next time he finds himself in Paris, he marries her (a kind British girl called Charlotte) under the authority of an army chaplain.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1918</i></center>' +
                '<p>Fog lies heavy across the meadows of Picardy. Amiens is in the East, but you might not know if you hadn\'t, a lifetime ago, passed the RAMC entrance test, which included geography beside the obvious categories of physiology and surgery. They say the Allies have pushed five miles westward still, having managed to take the Huns by surprise. They are ahead in this battle, and morale is high, but still the casualties flow in. The ones who can be carted off to the evacuating zone are dutifully carted, leaving the worst-off in the "collecting zone" for immediate care.</p>' +
                '<p>Captain Bly (he is well aware of the historical implications of his title in combination with his name) occupies the collecting zone nearest the front lines, where a triage station has been erected. He has scrambled for hours to suture gaping wounds, to excise bullets, to sever shattered appendages that he knows will not heal, to fill up with opium the men who will not go home.</p>' +
                '<p>In the auditorium of his mind, the arrhythmia of artillery is overlaid by the sound of Lucrezia Bori singing Strauss. One heavy thump marks the explosion of a shell nearby. They bring him a man who is dead or unconscious and scrabble away. A quick examination determines that this man does not need immediate care and should be bused on to a real hospital. But no one is watching. The surgeon drags his scalpel from above the man\'s right eyebrow, across his nose, and down his cheek. A trail of blood blooms.</p>' +
                '<p>It is not sadism, to leave this mark or the other marks. It is a gift. No one need know who from. He hastens to the next patient.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1921</i></center>' +
                '<p>The ward reeks of sickness, stale bodies, plaster. This is the last year of Edmund\'s commission. He will be free, soon, to abandon the domain of shell-shocked phantoms and seek out more illuminating climes. He has assurance from St. Bart\'s that there is a place for him on staff. He has sketched out plans for solitary travel to far-off places.</p>' +
                '<p>That pang of apology is for his younger self, who dreamed sane dreams that will not be fulfilled. He could never make to understand the boy he was, who spent no time contemplating divinity and who never looked across a smoldering battlefield dotted with the bodies of familiar men. That naive version of him still rears its head sometimes, makes him wonder if his quest for gnosis isn\'t wrong, somehow, or if he isn\'t going about it in all the wrong ways (progress overtakes the Hippocratic oath; his skill with a scalpel is honed often without the knowledge of the sleeping whetstone -- is there anything more stunning than the cartography of veins?). It troubles him. He will rid himself of trouble by pushing forward, forging farther.</p>' +
                '<p>News arrived not long ago that John is dead. Edmund may mourn eventually, but the immediate effect of the brother\'s death is the solution to a problem looming over the estate. John is their focus, and they will not pursue the matter if John is dead. Everything feels open.</p>' +
                '<center><i>1927</i></center>' +
                '<p>On the occasions that Charlotte and Edmund Bly accepted the social invitations extended by his colleagues, it was never clear to either of them if she was the ghost on his arm, or he on hers. She did a poorer job of hiding it. Onlookers who sensed her dissatisfaction could not bring themselves to blame her considerate, articulate husband, even in light of his obvious distaste for ever being in the wrong. How easy to overlook the foibles of a proud and talented man! It is she about whom they whispered when she turned away.</p>' +
                '<p>She shed innumerable tears over his expanding "pagan" practices; his abandonment of her to search for truth; his venomous strikes when he was home, when her nature as a human stumbling block made itself most obvious. Had he not been blinded by her situation ten years ago, he would have seen that she would not understand him. Had she not been in her predicament, she might have thought twice before marrying a surgeon with a temper. But it makes no difference now. She is dead before the breaking point. Pneumonia.</p>' +
                '<p>The boy (it was Edmund who insisted he be called Enoch, yet he has never managed to think of him as anything but "the boy") is old enough to make do with his nurses and a growing stable of tutors.

        biography: '<h2><center>Спасибо, родному Сталину за счастливое детство!</center></h2>' +
        '<p>Grigori Gavrilovich Volkov is a death’s head moth, his son’s ruination.</p>' +
        '<p>The metamorphosis from soft-bellied, soft-spoken poet to state threat begins on February 13th, 1917, when Anya Mikhailovna Volkova leaves to buy bread and never comes home to her husband and newborn son.  The vulturenecked neighbor who, a few days later, returns Anya’s wire-rimmed glasses, wrapped in a blood-speckled handkerchief, testifies that he saw her stumble into a partisan scuffle; that she was twice shot by an undiscriminating Bolshevik – once in the shoulder, and once in the head.  With no contradictory stories emerging from any quarter, and no body returned for burial, this account is inimitably engraved into Volkov canon; it is the fable that haunts all the other fables that Grigori whispers in his motherless son’s ear to lull him to sleep at night.  It is a chrysalis.</p>' +
        '<p>They (capital T, always capital) suggest, strongly, that his work could do more to glorify the state.  He is already so hollow that if he rips any more glorification from his belly he will collapse inward.  Instead he takes a job laying bricks: Пролетарии всех стран, соединяйтесь!  But a writer writes, and his scribblings continue, sore and shaking, by the light of little candle stubs in a corner of his increasingly unkempt apartment.  Before the revolution, he wrote calligraphed odes to sunsets and songbirds, the kind of verses that well-bred ladies memorized beneath the outspread arms of elm trees in summer.  After, his skies are blotted and his birds have pierced breasts and the Tsaritsa and her children have been relieved of poems and whatever else occupied the long halls of their memory before Russia was stained red.  His <i>nouvel oeuvre</i> is published piecemeal in the underground journals that an insurgence-minded literati pass among one another and use to warm their fingers when they are done.  He adopts a pseudonym, but everyone knows the hand behind the swirling, hypnagogic polemics that turn stranger and more virulent with the passing years.</p>' +
        '<p>Dima grows up with no direct knowledge of the untroubled world he reads about -- and summarily rejects -- in his papa\'s musty library.  His microcosm, all that makes up the known universe, is that Ulitsa Volodarskovo apartment which, while he calls it home, is divided in half to make space for new families; the exhausted mutterings of an inattentive father; the soot-tinged streets of Petrograd and its crowds that reek of fear; the snarling boys at the state-run school where he learns his letters and his arithmetic, his history and his survival of the fittest.  How he retains with almost no effort the lion’s share of everything he sees, reads, hears, is kept close.  The failing marks he earns come with effort.  (Intelligent, opines a gouty instructor to a colleague, but truant, easily distracted, prone to outbursts and to brawls -- a troublesome boy.)</p>' +
        '<p>Time trudges by.  Gaunt waifs, the remnants of the purged, have begun to infest the streets like lice.  Housewives spit беспризорные like a curse.  The strays pick pockets and steal scraps from dogs.  Evenings, in a show of latent prescience, Dima learns their names and their rough cant.  He takes to running and sparring with them instead of going home.  He harbors a young boy’s envy of their ostensible freedom, but little comprehension of their travails.  When his father hears who his son\'s playmates are, he beats him, crying, <i>you do not belong with them</i>.  Madman\'s truth.</p>' +
        '<p>When the wolves come (sharp-toothed and lean in sheepskin dusters), no-one is surprised.  They make no excuses as they wrench the poet from his cloister.  Nevermind the boy, eleven years old, curls unshorn, watching from the kitchen doorway in a sleep-muted daze.  Their concern is agitators, not agitators’ brats.  At break of dawn the landlady trots to city hall and reports an orphan taking up valuable space in her building.  In the afternoon a middle-aged man tries to ferry Dmitri Volkov, whom he finds sitting on the floor, waiting for his father, to an orphanage (he will be fed and well looked after; the Party cares for its lost children, мой маленький товарищ), but the boy snarls, slips away and loses himself in the bedlam of crowded streets and backstreets, in the land of hollow-cheeked children who christen him ягненочка: with no home to return to when the sun sets, he is not as bold as he was.  With no rublei to be had from him, they are not so friendly.  They function as a network of packs, and he soon learns his place is at the bottom.  He had a kind of fierceness among schoolboys, but among the unclaimed he is not fierce enough to rise far.  Jungle law: he attacks what is smaller than him, cringes before what is not.  For weeks he weeps, until snow falls and the fountain of his grief freezes over and forms something smooth and impenetrable (В грозных айсбергах марсово поле, И Лебяжья лежит в хрусталях … How quickly he would trade all his useless memories, lines and smells and faces, for a few minutes’ peace of mind.)</p>' +
        '<p>He is fifteen when the doctor spots him pawing through a dustbin, although he looks younger and feels older and cannot claim any number of years for himself with any certainty, and anyway the doctor does not ask his age, only if he is hungry, which he has been for a thousand days.  More.  It is not the first time he has traded his pride for a morsel (or a swallow, or a stale cigarette).  In truth he has no pride left to trade.  The doctor takes him, not to a fetid alleyway, but to his home, to his study -- the walls of books stir something nostalgic in the boy as he braces himself against the desk -- and it is rough first, then gentle, and the lambkin for his trouble is fed chicken soup the doctor’s daughter cooked, and before he is turned out he is told to come again.</p>' +
        '<p>Dima does go back again, and again he is used and petted and fed and sent away, and so it continues.  The longer it goes on the more they talk -- and the man becomes <i>the doctor</i> instead of <i>the pervert</i>, извращенец.  He works at City Hospital No. 40, he knows the names of all bones and muscles, his wife is dead, his son moved with the government to Moscow, his daughter toils long hours in the post office, after he is cruel he is tender.  When Dima tells him his father’s name (his tongue has not formed those sounds in what feels like a lifetime), there is something so ugly in the doctor’s laugh that it turns Dima crimson and determined to never speak it out loud again.</p>' +
        '<p>Listen, the doctor says one day, the Party wants me in Moscow, and you can stay here and rot in the gutter, or you can come with me, the strings are mine for pulling.  You can be my assistant; no worse than those whelps out of medical school.  No one else will do this for you.  Dima does not now, nor will he ever, understand the doctor’s motivations.  One thing he does understand and very well is that between all the world’s knowledge and a warm bed, he would rather have the latter.  Why ask questions whose answers don’t matter?  Petrograd, Leningrad, whatever they call the city anymore, it holds nothing for him.  He agrees.</p>' +
        '<p>The Moscow project is sinister: in a cramped laboratory on Varsonofevskii Pereulok, they test poisons.  On rats, on birds, on dogs, on prisoners.  This is classified work -- Dima must be sworn in as an agent of the NKVD to perform it, though he does little but clean flasks and take dictation and bite his tongue when the doctor runs fingers along his arm.  Some of the other young men, those medical school whelps, shudder to see the shadow of death creep into the eyes of the living -- but Dima has seen this enough in the sunken eyes of his starving packmates that it does not occur to him to turn away.  An observant officer takes notice of the young man’s callousness and proposes a change of situation.  Yagoda is looking for recruits to serve the cause of the nation.</p>' +
        '<p>They say with dark humor that the Lubyanka is the tallest building in Moscow, since you can see Siberia from the basement. In defiance of all logic, Dima finds himself somewhere in its viscera, sludging through competency exams and tests of fitness, pledging his allegiance again and again to the state, aiming a pistol at a target, repeating banal phrases in broken English.  He absorbs as he as always absorbed and asks no questions.  A good soldier, his sense of <i>why</i> has been excised somewhere along the way like those fleshy organs -- миндалины, червеобразный отросток -- that are apt to cause more harm than good if left intact.  Preventative, to cut them out before they fester.</p>' +
        '<p>Pulp novels will take “espionage” and drape it with black velvet romanticism.  Cloak and dagger, spy versus spy.  Dima perceives nothing romantic in his existence, which consists of short stretches in foreign countries -- Germany, France, England -- conveying sensitive information and eliminating Socialism’s many and varied foes, sometimes gaudily and sometimes with the poisons he assisted the doctor (purged in 1938 with 3000 others) to concoct and test, all while a war gnaws away at the integrity of an entire world.  But he is alive, clean, fed.  Fastidious in his spartan flat and forever aware of the alternatives.  Other men his age are scattering pieces of themselves along the western front, but the skillful are too valuable to waste on the battlefield.</p>' +
        '<p>Not a stretch, to characterize Dima as skilled.  His English is idiomatic, his French passable, his aim precise, his conscience a chasm with no bottom; he can shuffle fictitious personal details back and forth with the dexterity of a cardshark dealing a hand of poker, and he comports himself in a manner almost universally perceived as non-threatening until the very moment he becomes a threat.  Some of his colleagues possess oily charm, and they are sent to make friends and turn politicians.  Some sweat devastation from their pores, and they have other uses.  Dmitri’s ilk are sent on operations that must be handled sleekly, with few ripples.  This is what makes the Canadian disaster such a surprise.</p>' +
        '<p>Or maybe not so much a surprise.  ведь, the girl is a walking disaster, wildcat in gypsyflesh.  Disaster breeds disaster.  Once before he dealt with her and came away with cuts and bruises for his troubles.  His fault, perhaps.  They tried to use him to teach, but he is no teacher; lacks the aura of authority one needs to command.  She could smell deficiency on him like an animal, no different from the feral children of his youth.  Knowing does little to diminish his indisposition to work with her again.  Stronger: he could strangle her in her sleep and not regret it, if he were not so bound by injunction.  Neither does she seem pleased by the situation.  Nevertheless, there he is between her and a hot lump of lead, pulled like a tide into the line of fire.  He knows better than to ask why.  As the bullet bores into his belly (flash of the morgue in the Специальный кабинет, some gulag trash on a table with his stomach butterflied open, intestines and all on display, and if you ever doubted, you know there can be nothing secret or sacred in the world) he supposes that’s the end of it.  She’ll leave him like a shrugged burden and carry on her duty.  It could have ended worse, in an old capitol alleyway.</p>' +
        '<p>In twenty-six years, no one taught him religion.  He has no prayers or expectations of either salvation or damnation.  The dead die.  They rot.  Still.  When he wakes, for a few minutes before lucidity blooms, he wonders if this is something that comes after life.  Heaven, Hell, he knows the words in three languages, and he knows that it will not be the former which lies waiting on the other side of his eyelids.  The same as he has met each new unfolding in his life, he faces this without the faintest glimmer of having any choice in the matter.  But there is no esoteric judgment or punishment to meet him, only a dark room and, blurry, the girl, whose face he watches for uncountable seconds before she notices.  He is sore, starving, withering from thirst, and all these needs combine into a startling desire and redirect at her, as if death, on its departure, has left an ember in him which has caught.  That she lets him have her is startling, too.  It is all startling and shrouded in a veil of not-quite-reality that takes its time to fade.  He is what the world has made him: rough first, then gentle.</p>' +
        '<p>If you ask him if he loves her, you will earn yourself a stare that straddles non-comprehension and hostility.  Love is as foreign and abstract as god, nothing is going to change that.  But when he looks at her he feels something that he cannot put a word to, that he never noticed with his father, or the doctor, or the street girls who fucked him to stay warm, or the foreign whores, or anyone he has known who might have stirred any species of love in him.  He goes along with the marriage -- a foolish idea, her idea -- without balking.  They are still strangers, in a sense.  What little she knows about him is snippets, vagaries, half-lies.  He can only imagine his knowledge of her is the same.  Married strangers.  Married rule-breakers.  He has rarely broken the rules.  Stern glares and reprimands from the organization, whatever its letters in 1945, when it learns.</p>' +
        '<p>Byron Fields is a transfer student from Oxford (explanation for the accent), wounded in duty (explanation for the scars, the badly-healed bullet wound), in the States to finish a surgical degree.  He has the papers, the records, the vocabulary, the internist’s knowledge, the last-minute practice with a scalpel, the false-sister/lover.  No end to the care they must take, and at the same time as they worm their way into Project Snow, the strange connection they forged wears thinner.</p>' +
        '<p>Ask if he loves her in 1952.  Non-comprehension, mild hostility.  He has other things on his mind.  He is the unflappable Snow surgeon (Fields of Snow, to be used in case of emergency), all business, reserved but not unapproachable.  The kind of man you can bring your problems to and expect to get a rational answer from.  And maybe you wouldn’t be wrong if you suggested that the isolation is getting to him (who isn’t it getting to?); or if you quietly remarked that, on occasion, his reactions are not quite what one would expect; or if you wondered if there might have been a faintly dangerous glint in his eyes the last time he looked at you.  He notices, too, when he wakes up mumbling moldy Russian.  He has never not been himself for so long, and while it was rarely a pleasure to be Dmitri Volkov, it was always to that familiar bed of nails that he returned.  Necessary ritual.  Restorative.  Volkov writhes.  Fields frays at the seams.</p>'

	biography:
	'<p><b>Description:</b></p>' +
	'<p>Spray of freckles across a heart-shaped face. Snub nose, small lips, a tumble of russet hair. For all that her parts taken individually might suggest a certain appeal, in sum she is an odd thing at the best angle, homely at the worst -- a dour-faced kid whose gaunt frame, long limbs, and hesitant quirk of movement grant her an aspect of a tree insect dressed up as a girl in clothes that don’t quite fit.</p>' +
	'<p><b>History:</b></p>' +
	'<p>The first time I ran away, I went to Rebecca Lyttle’s place, down the block. We managed to smoke a joint between us and draw a route from Atlanta to Nashville on her dad’s AAA road map (she wanted to be Dolly Parton, I wanted to be anything at all -- or not <i>anything</i>, I wanted to paint landscapes for a while, what a joke that makes now, right?) before el profe and la profa showed up to drag me home. They grounded me for a week. She drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon, not that it helped my grades at all. They took away my radio. I drew monsters all over the walls. They thought I learned a lesson.</p>' +
	'<p>The second time I did a little better, hitched a ride and made it all the way to the promised land behind the Dunwoody Metroplex before a cop picked me up and called them at work. Papi slapped my face in the middle of the police station, everybody staring and I <i>knew</i> at least the secretary in her turtleneck was thinking poor thing. I liked it, them figuring it was all his fault, driving me to the fuckups and dropouts. Look, I don’t know. They didn’t beat me. They didn’t rape me or starve me. I know a hundred kids who got it worse, and believe me they never understood what I was trying to get away from either. I just couldn’t be there sometimes, like the books and the Wallbangers and the politics were closing in, maybe I could breathe if I got far enough away and they’d tell me <i>just wait until you’re older</i>, Maria Teresa but you don’t know if older’s going to happen. Julie, my best friend until second grade, when we still lived in Jersey, got hit by a car trying to cross the street and that was all there was, never got to do anything. When I thought he was going to kill me -- I don’t think he’s not going to now, but when I thought it was going to happen <i>right then</i> -- it was like see? No guaranteed tomorrow, right? Anyway, I kept leaving, a few days here, a few there, until they weren’t surprised anymore when school called, when they couldn’t find me. I always came back, like the cat. They’re probably still expecting me to show up on the doorstep. But I don’t want to think about that.</p>' +
	'<p>After a while, I realized I didn’t need to go far to get lost. Downtown might as well be the moon, nobody can find you if you don’t want to be found. That was the last time, with this punk Jer Thornton in his shitty apartment, sucking vodka out of the bottle. I went to get gummy bears, took a shortcut to the 7-Eleven, and that was it, when I woke up my whole body hurt and I couldn’t see. I think that was the only time he apologized, and it wasn’t even an apology, like Sorry, I needed someone. You hear that, you think sex or murder or both, but I got snatched by the one freak in Atlanta looking for an instrument. So he’s killing me slowly instead (which is why he won’t do it himself, tracking and and twisting and listening to the dead, they eat you from the inside once they get in), and the sex, that’s on me, when I thought I was going to go crazy. Not that he’s too upset about it.</p>' +
	'<p>Here’s what I know: it’s to find somebody who screwed him over, and screwed me, too, I figure -- not that I wouldn’t make him suffer if I had the chance -- and she leaves these snail trails that glow so I can see even though he fucked up my eyes, and I’ve gotten him close. Wherever we are, it’s hot. Loud. We move around but never go very far. He leaves me alone when he goes out to paint traps that sting when they’re tripped (and they aren’t much), but I can’t pass the borders. And he brings people. Just to impress, sometimes, and sometimes to bleed. Better them than me.</p>'

Clean disciplinary record & no history of mental health issues prior to this period. He presents as asymptomatic for depression at time of evaluation, but has received more writeups in the past year than all other years combined, mostly for minor and non sentence-affecting infractions the amount of which, considered in conjunction with my predecessor"s notes, nevertheless indicate a drastic of outlook/heightened impulsivity since that event. </p> <p> Intelligence tests completed with average to slightly above-average results. Interacted easily throughout most of interview. Inmate is largely conversational and even highly engaging when the topic is one that interests him, although prone to obscenity and casual exaggeration/misrepresentation of truths that I was able to identify and point out due to familiarity with his record. Confrontation on such points resulted alternately in nonchalant acknowledgment and voiced annoyance. Questions toward plans after impending release met with a degree of nihilism that I find personally concerning but which is not in itself diagnosable. Moderate defiance of authority - possibly espec. female authority - evidenced by frequent attempts to divert the direction of the interview to unrelated/undesired topics, multiple times to my own personal life, in spite of my continual insistence that we focus on the task at hand. Also via several attempts to proposition me throughout the course of interview, again in spite of my firm insistence that he cease. </p> <p> His demeanor did change notably (turning reticent, contentious) in several instances, when I broached the subject of his family and his faith. Faith: refusal to discuss the specifics of religion followed (led?) before imprisonment; still, oblique comments lead me to believe that he does not now practice nor does he intend to practice upon release. Family: no evidence of remorse for the murder of his wife, the crime to which he was imprisoned. Open hostility when asked about other living relatives. Records indicate that he has only once responded to the semi-regular correspondence sent to him by his daughter; however he has provided her address for post-release. Discussion of his relationship with her limited to monosyllabic responses, apparent detachment. </p> <p>Due to unpredictability and frequent mode-switching between glibness and hostility, potential for one or more Cluster B personality disorders, however further evaluation required to determine specific diagnosis and/or comorbidity if any. Although I anticipate a moderate-to-high possibility of antisocial behavior once released, I cannot say that this makes a strong enough case to prevent the impending discharge of Mr. Erewaker, esp. as his full sentence has been served and he requires no further medical intervention for previous psychological concerns.</p> </p> </div></div><div class = "psych-stats-row" style = "font-size: .9em">

class="location">San Bernardino, California</div> <div class="year">MCMLXXXIV</div> </div> <p> In contrast to so many of the so-called “new religions” which actively seek to spread a worldview, The Fifth World Congregation, based in rural Arizona, is defined by a remarkable insularity, with membership fluctuating between twenty and one hundred members throughout the years that data has been available. Any study, including ours, must necessarily maintain a focus on the past, as the self-contained structure of the sect severely restricts access to current practices and conditions. </p> <p> Illuminative is a brief overview of the Fifth World Congregation’s foundations, which can be traced to one Elliott Erewaker, the group’s founder, whose descendants have maintained preeminence in the group into the present. Erewaker was born in 1881 to a Boston doctor and heiress wife. Very little information of note is available about his early life, but records indicate that he graduated medical school before embarking for the Western Territories when he was twenty-two. He settled in Arizona territory and started a medical practice of his own some time between 1902 and 1905. In 1907, he claimed to have experienced a spiritual revelation, after which he began calling himself Meshelemiah (Hebrew, ‘whom Jehovah repays’), ceased to practice medicine, and started construction of a homestead on the the plot of land Northwest of Phoenix that his family and adherents still work and occupy today. </p> <p> Knowledge of current Fifth World Congregation’s organization, practices, and eschatology has been gleaned largely from literature distributed in the nineteen-sixties, when a short-lived marketing effort led to the appearance of a number of cryptic tracts and flyers heralding fifty years until a violent end to the "current" world, the coming of a godlike redeemer, and the opportunity for a select few (Fifth World Congregants) to pass into a better world; and, at the same time, the granting of limited access to “The Manor” to several journalistic outlets over several years, the resulting articles of which describe a self-sufficient, chiefly agrarian community with a reverence for the natural world, strict definitions of moral behavior, and a syncretic belief system borrowing from Meso-American and Hopi religions, in addition to Christianity and Judaism. It is presumably this burst of publicity that continues to attract interest and new followers today: no literature or press has appeared since 1968. </p> </div><div class="page-invisible" id="magazine-page1"> <div class="title">SOUND Issue 14, November 1990</div> <div class="magazine-header">ON THE B-SIDE with Patience Pool</div> <div class="intro">Rare groove trio Leaving Phase and The Defaulted Comedy snuck their way onto the radar this year with their surprise hit “Passion Vaccine,” but they’ve been making a name for themselves along the West Coast with their unpredictable mix of jazz, punk, and roots since the mid-eighties.

Same same same. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name"> PATIENCE:</span> Speaking of Randy, is there any truth to the rumors that the delay of your next album is due to tensions between the two of you? </p> <p> <span class="magazine-name">Z:</span> Might be. Might be we don’t give a shit about the next album. But my advice? Believe every rumor you hear, just to be safe. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name">PATIENCE:</span> I’ve gotten some of the best advice from musicians. You make an interesting point, though: a lot of plebes know Leaving Phase now thanks to “Passion Vaccine,” off of your freshman album, Disgrace Of A Different Kind, but I’ve heard a few long-time fans say that the only real experience is the live performance. One-of-a-kind variations, one-offs no one ever hears again, half-hour improv sessions, chanting. Was that always the intention? </p> <p> <span class="magazine-name">Z:</span> What, transience? Sure it was, babe. Not like we sat around before we started and wrote ‘transience’ on a bar napkin and framed it, but I think we were all coming from similar places and that’s where it was leading. You’d have to ask the other guys to be sure. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name">PATIENCE:</span> What about you?

Dingos, desert, tumbleweeds. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name">PATIENCE:</span> Sounds inspiring. That’s where the acid jazz took root? </p> <p> <span class="magazine-name">Z:</span> [Laughing] More like the hymns. The family’s pretty uptight, which explains a lot I guess; I had to smuggle in the secular stuff, once I found out secular stuff existed. Not that having Bibley shit in the repertoire doesn’t come in handy. We did a pretty heavy take on Before Jehovah’s Awful Throne the other night, I don’t think the godless motherfuckers knew what hit them. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name">PATIENCE:</span> Anything to say to the people who think Leaving Phase, and your style of music in general, is a flash in the pan? </p> <p> <span class="magazine-name">Z:</span> They’re right, and it doesn’t make any difference. It’s <i>all</i> a flash in the pan. Nobody’s going to give a fuck about Beethoven either, when it all comes crashing down. And that"s sooner than you think, sweetie, so live it up. </p> </div> <div> <p> <span class="magazine-name">PATIENCE:</span> Hopefully not <i>too</i> soon.

Darrow was found with multiple lacerations, including a slashed throat, which the medical examiner’s office initially ruled self-inflicted. </p> <p> "We might never have known that anything happened," said Robert Gill, lead detective on the case, at the time. "They pretty much keep to themselves out there. We don’t get hardly any complaints. I thank God somebody had the good sense to report it so that we could notify her family. They hadn’t heard from her in four years. At least now they know." </p> <p> Darrow, 31, was a native of Cloudersport, PA. She moved to Arizona in 1993 after developing a fascination with the FWC’s fervent doomsday message and insular lifestyle, according to her father, Rufus Darrow, who survives her along with her mother and two brothers. </p> <p> “You never met a sweeter kid,” he told us over the phone. “Beautiful, warm, trusting. She was always drawn to that kind of thing -- she was looking for something to believe in. I never did understand why she landed on that [The Fifth World Congregation]. But one thing I’m sure about is the Helen I knew never would have taken her own life. Either something else is going on here, or something terrible happened to her. We aren’t going to lie down about this. We aren’t going to rest until we know the truth.” </p> <p> The grieving father’s determination may have had an effect: newly-discovered evidence has led to the incident being re-examined as possibly suspicious. Details have yet to be released, but numerous members of the sect, including the founding Erewaker family, have been seen coming and going from the police station, and multiple searches have taken place within the boundaries of the fenced property. </p> <p> Fifth World Congregation spokesperson Judith Ferguson released the following statement in response to a request for comment, "The death of our sister, Helah, [members of the FWC go by selected Biblical names] is a tragedy. She was beloved among the congregation, and we will miss the light of her spirit every day that we are without it. We are deeply troubled that the authorities have chosen to distort our personal loss into an opportunity to pry into our lives. Nevertheless, we are cooperating fully because we are secure in the knowledge that no foul play was involved in Helah"s self-inflicted death." </p> </div> </div> <div class="page-invisible" id="letter-page2"> <div class="letter-date">6/21/2010</div> <div class="letter-text" id="letter-why">WHY?</div> </div> <div class="page-invisible" id="letter-page3"> <div class="letter-date"></div> <div class="letter-date">12/15/2012</div> <div class="letter-text">If it ends, wait for me.</div> </div> <div class="page-invisible" id="incident-page1"> <div style="border-bottom: 1px solid black;"> <div class="title">ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS</div> <div class="title">MAJOR MISCONDUCT REPORT (Please Print or Type)</div> </div> <div class="row"> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Prisoner Number </div> <div class="script"> 354283 </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Prisoner Name </div> <div class="script"> Camp </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Institution </div> <div class="script"> ASP </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Violation Date </div> <div class="script"> 8-15-13 </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Time & Place of Violation </div> <div class="script"> 1340 library </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Housing Unit </div> <div class="script"> D </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Room/Cell/Bunk </div> <div class="script"> --- </div> </div> <div style="width: 25%; border-right: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;"> <div class="print"> Reporting Staff Member"s Name </div> <div class="script"> J Herrera </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div style="width: 100%"> <div class="print"> Name of Major Misconduct Charge </div> <div class="script"> 02B-Assault on Inmate </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div style="width: 100%"> <div class="print"> Describe Violation </div> <div class="script"> During afternoon rounds on 8/15/13, I discovered inmate Camp attacking inmate Montes with a sharp implement (later I determined this to be a shank made from a toothbrush).

Ordered Erewaker to keep his distance and called for backup immediately, then used pepper spray to successfully subdue Montes/prevent further injury to camp. Confiscated shank and waited for assistance while keeping Montes in check. Montes crying the whole time after being separated from camp, hysterical, shouting that it wasn’t his fault, something else was making him move. SORT arrived 13:47 to escort Montes to solitary. I assisted in transporting Camp to medical wing on stretcher. Camp woke up on the way, talking quietly what sounded like apologizing. When I asked him the reason for the attack he said they had been planning to jump Erewaker. Something about the world not ending, Erewalker, demons. Lost consciousness again before I could get more info. Condition currently critical. Will follow up when medical allows. </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="page-invisible" id="release-page1"> <div id="release-header"> <div id="release-title"> PRISONER RELEASE NOTIFICATION </div> <div id="release-source"> <div id="doj"> U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE </div> <div id="fbop"> FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS </div> </div> </div> <div id="release-date"> DATE: <span class="release-hand">5/1/2016</span> </div> <div id="release-text"> <span class="release-hand"></span> <p><span class="release-stat">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4042, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is notifying your office of the release of an offender who, based upon available information, was convicted of a federal drug trafficking crime, or a crime of violence.

To those of us in whom the ancestral blood is most potent, remnants of the once-living appear without summoning or ritual as clearly as any fleshly being and unto them speak their secrets. For this purpose we have cultivated the blood. we know also that what lingers of the dead changes after a time; that the long incorporeal are stranger and know more & remember less of their corporeal heritage than the newly deceased.</p><p>We know that spirits even the oldest and most foreign among them which may be clumsily termed ‘angel’ & ‘demon’ (true angels and demons being wholly different classifications with which our line has little influence), may be bound to the will of one who carries the blood, provided that he performs all steps of the necessary ritual, including the recitations of the secret tongue which was spoken before the fracturing of this the fourth world & the calling of names & the delineation of symbols & the arrangement of artefacts.</p><p>We do know that any spirit recently torn from its mortal vessel may be affixed to it once more with ease, & that the flesh thereby resurrected continues to deteriorate in spite of being restored to liveliness.</p><p>We do know that any spirit may be affixed to a foreign vessel & that this vessel may be one with the blood or indeed any person chosen as host provided that the correct ritual is completed.</p><p>We do know that spirits tending to bear malice toward the living who have the capacity for command, altho not governed strictly by time and place, do gather & congregate wheresoever those with the blood may dwell, & that they may be deterred by certain sacrifices & ceremonies toward the purpose of binding spirit vigils to a site.</p></div> </div> <div style = "border-top: 1px solid white; padding-top: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"> <h2>Footnotes on the dark arts from beyond the fourth wall</h2> <ol><li><b>Congenital Mediumship</b>: Like the majority of the Erewaker bloodline, from a young age Z was aware of seeing, hearing, and answering whichever nearby spirits of the dead cared to be witnessed. This has often been a double-edged sword for them, as spirits of the dead -- and often malicious ones -- will tend to congregate where they can be seen, a situation which led to the necessity of the banishing/appeasement rituals performed by the Fifth World Congregation.</li><p><li><b>Necromancy</b>: The family has long practiced a form of ceremonial magic related to (and possibly the progenitor of, depending on whom you ask) Enochian magic, focused on the invocation and commanding of the spirits of the dead. Their library of complex rituals involves knowledge of an ostensibly pre-Babel argot, evocations, sigils, grids, tables, talismans, and sheer force of will -- and are therefore difficult to undertake without serious planning and forethought.<p>While conceivably any venture involving any combination of the dead and the living might be accomplished via the performance of the correct ritual, The FWC"s preoccupation with purity and right action limited the number of rituals passed down the generations to those considered necessary to their livelihood -- largely the deterrence of said gathering spirits, a business which entails the creation and harnessing of familiar ones. Zedekiah, therefore, can invoke specific spirits as long as he has some physical token of theirs from life; allow invoked spirits to possess him; implant invoked spirits into the bodies of others (provided certain conditions respecting the would-be host"s willingness/level of consciousness are met); and implant spirits into recently-deceased bodies (without restoring actual functioning to said bodies). None of this comes without considerable effort, preparation, or (especially in his case, as his separation from his family for about a decade when he should have been practicing left him catching up in his late twenties), the distinct possibility of outright failure or unfavorable results -- these ranging from accidental possession to madness to death. His personal domain over invoked spirits is limited by the geographic space that he has prepared for the ritual (although more proficient family members do not share this limitation), and he has no command over flesh or anything that was not at one point human, alive, and subsequently severed from the physical realm.</li> </ol> </div>'
