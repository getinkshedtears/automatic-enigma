                        <p className = 'posts-p'>While a marginal chance exists that I might be able to chat about your favorite fandom on an OOC level, I am only interested in writing original plots in original settings with original characters. (Yeah, I know, nothing new under the sun.)</p>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>An injection of non-standard weirdness -- ghosts, demons, curses, murderers, secret societies, evil babies -- into an otherwise mundane universe is my favorite thing. Like fleur de sel on chocolate chip cookies. I keep away from wholly fictional worlds, from high fantasy, and from hard science fiction. My happy place is a sort of grimdark fantastic realism.  Influences: Lynch, Tarkovsky, Eco, Bola√±o, Peake, Donoso.</p>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>Plots from scratch are preferable, but several of my starters as adoptable and would be willing to use them as jumping-off points for something new if such a thing would be appealing. Let me know!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <div className = 'posts-header'>Maturity</div>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>Your limits, should you have any, will be respected within reason. I have none: if you're putting so much effort into making me uncomfortable that I'm offended, then you're not concentrating hard enough on writing, and we won't work well together.</p>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>I'm happy enough to write explicit sex scenes if the plot naturally goes in that direction.  Plotless porn isn't my cup of tea, <i>but</i> I am more likely to be talked into a sexcentric setup if it involves godawful taboo-breaking elements.</p>

                    <div>
                        <div className = 'posts-header'>Pace</div>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>I am a writing tortoise. I have a personal rule to respond within a week of the last time I heard from you; I don't guarantee anything faster than that, but if I had to estimate, I'd put my average turnaround time at about three days unless we're rapid-firing. To compensate for my lack of alacrity, I am mad dependable and will continue writing with you for years if you stick around.</p>

                    <div>
                        <div className = 'posts-header'>Elements of Style</div>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>I default to writing in the third person and from the limited perspective of a single main character (from which I'll occasionally stray for narrative purposes); but I enjoy writing casts and have no problem moving around a handful of characters in a single scene. I will get upset with you if you try to put words in the mouth of any character I've put more than a sentence into describing without asking me.</p>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>My typical post is about 3 paragraphs long, but I don't spend a lot of time counting words. Introductory offerings are longer. Examples of both can be clicked on to the left.</p>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>Quality matters!  I don't promise perfection, but I do promise effort behind every post.  I proofread, I reread, and I try to produce writing that could conceivably be published without a lot of editing.  I prefer to write with people who take an equally writing-serious approach.</p>

                    <div>
                        <div className = 'posts-header'>Media</div>
                        <p className = 'posts-p'>As far as I'm concerned, if you can put words on it and they stay there, it is a viable roleplaying medium. Google Drive, private forums, public forums, blank white webpages with nothing but words, Storium, Tumblr, email: all perfectly acceptable. A very important exception: You will not get me on an instant messaging program unless I think you are just everything. And I don't think anyone is everything.</p>
